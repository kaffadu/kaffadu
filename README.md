## 🚀 About Me

I'm a seasoned **Site Reliability Engineer** with over **5+ years** of hands-on experience in designing, automating, and optimizing cloud-native infrastructure and CI/CD ecosystems. I thrive on building resilient, scalable systems that serve millions of users—currently ensuring Sky UK's broadcast and streaming platforms run smoothly.

My philosophy is simple: **automate everything, monitor relentlessly, and learn continuously**. I bridge the gap between development and operations, fostering a true DevOps culture to accelerate delivery while maximizing reliability.
